# Mreg CLI

## Category and Location Validation

Add category and location validation to CLI commands in mreg-cli. They have been removed from model methods such as Network.set_category() and Network.set_location() in this package.

## List GET Request Limits

Adjust limit for list GET requests when using MregApiClient to be 500 (if desired). New default is None (no limit). This affects the following methods:

- MregApiClient.get_list()
- MregApiClient.get_list_generic()
- MregApiClient.get_typed()

## OutputManager Removal in models

OutputManager.add_line() calls have been removed from mreg_api.api.models and replaced with an internal note system using `FrozenModel.add_note()`. This allows tracking informational messages without direct CLI output.

For now, this is implemented as a `list[str]` private attribute `_notes` in `FrozenModel`, with an `add_note()` method to append notes. However, if richer functionality is needed later, a `Note` class could be created.

Commands can retrieve notes from model instances using a new `get_notes()` method.

# Mreg API

## Docstrings

Ruff's pydocstyle ruleset does not support sphinx style docstrings. Docstrings should be converted to google style.

## Force

References to "force" in error messages should be removed. The CLI should be the only place where "force" is relevant.
