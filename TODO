# Mreg CLI

Add category and location validation to CLI commands in mreg-cli. They have been removed from model methods such as Network.set_category() and Network.set_location() in this package.

Adjust limit for list GET requests when using MregApiClient to be 500 (if desired). New default is None (no limit). This affects the following methods:

- MregApiClient.get_list()
- MregApiClient.get_list_generic()
- MregApiClient.get_typed()
